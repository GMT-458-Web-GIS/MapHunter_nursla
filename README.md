## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### 1. The Mission
You have **120 seconds** to reach a target score of **400 points**.  
Your goal is to find hidden Pokémon scattered across the map using your radar and spatial awareness.

### 2. Pokémon Types & Difficulty
Strategies change based on the Pokémon you are hunting:

| Icon | Pokémon | Difficulty | Points | Behavior |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/official-artwork/1.png" width="30"> | **Bulbasaur** | 🟢 Easy | **+25** | Always visible. Easy to catch. |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/official-artwork/4.png" width="30"> | **Charmander** | 🟠 Medium | **+50** | **Timed!** Disappears after 20 seconds. |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/other/official-artwork/94.png" width="30"> | **Gengar** | 🔴 Hard | **+100** | **Hidden & Fast!** Only visible at deep zoom levels. Flees in 10s! |

### 3. Proximity Sensor (Radar)
Since some Pokémon are hidden, you must rely on your sensor:
- **Signal Bar:** Fills up as you get closer to a target.
- **Alert:** The panel glows <span style="color:red">**RED**</span> and shakes when you are within **200m**.
- **Zoom Mechanic:** Rare Pokémon (like Gengar) only appear when you zoom in (Level 17+).
